# Time Complexity Example: Bubble Sort

Set launch target to `bubble_sort_timing` (see targets in `CMakeLists.txt`). 

## Analyze Runtime Directly

1. Run `./bubble_sort_timing` and look at the output. 
2. How does the runtime increase with $N$?

## Analyze Runtime with Excel

1. Run `./bubble_sort_timing  > output.csv`
2. Open `output.csv` in Excel. 
3. Remove all 0s (Excel trendlines don't work with 0s).
4. Make a line chart (make sure $N$ is on the x-axis).
5. Add a trendline (turn on the equation and R-squared).
