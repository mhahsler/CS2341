# Chapter 1: Programming

This chapter is a review of important concepts and their C++ implementation 
used in this course. Very good short explanations can be found in this
[C++ YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb).

## Classes and Templates
* A simple class called [IntCell](IntCell)
* [Function and class templates](templates)

## Dynamic Memory Allocation and Pointers
* Some Questions:
  - Where do programs store variables and objects?
  - Where does memory come from and how is memory returned?
  - Why do we need dynamic memory allocation?
  - What is the difference between the stack and the heap.

  See [program memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment).

* Example: Create a memory diagram for executing the following program:

    ```cpp
    int inc(int x) return x + 1;

    int main() {
      int a = 10;
      int b = inc(a);
      return 0;
    }
    ```

  - What are the differences between memory management in C, C++, Java and Python? (Most programming languages use very similar mechanisms.)
    |                | C   | C++ | Java | Python |
    | :------------- | :-: | :-: | :--: | :----: |
    | Request dynamic memory |  ?  |  ?  |   ?  |   ?    |
    | Return dynamic memory  |  ?  |  ?  |   ?  |   ?    |

## Standard Template Library

Most programming languages come with a library of ready-to-use data structures (abstract data types often called collections) and algorithms to supplement
its primitive data types. Java has the [Java collections framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_collections_framework) including [`java.util`]. Python has a [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) built into the language.

C++ has the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
